# Classification-Challenge
Module 13 - May 20
The correct file with the answers is the one with the "-final" in the name. 
I was behind on this module as I had to miss a day of class the week this material was presented and I've now caught up. to begin completing this project:
- I reviewed the presentation recordings for the day I missed
- I used the recordings to complete the assignment - instead of breaking to complete the student assignments during class, I completed this homework.
- I had minor syntax errors with capitalization of some of the variable names in the code and went to office hours on 6/6/24 as I could not find guidance in other resources
- After my project work was done I finished correcting errors before submission.
